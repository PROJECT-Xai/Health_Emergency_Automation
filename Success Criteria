The success criteria for a delivery drone system that uses AI can vary depending on the specific goals and requirements of the system. However, some common criteria that are often used to evaluate the success of such systems include:

1.	Efficiency: The system should be able to deliver packages quickly and efficiently, reducing delivery costs and delivery time.(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40313-021-00828-4)(https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/1/360/htm)
2.	Reliability: The system should be able to consistently deliver packages to their intended destinations with a high degree of accuracy and precision.(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40313-021-00828-4)
3.	Safety: The system should be designed with safety in mind, ensuring that the drones do not pose a risk to people or property during their operation.
4.	Scalability: The system should be able to handle an increasing volume of packages as demand for the service grows.(https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/1/360/htm)
5.	Regulatory compliance: The system should comply with all relevant laws and regulations governing the use of drones for package delivery.(https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/1/360/htm)

These are just some examples of success criteria that could be used to evaluate a delivery drone system that uses AI. Ultimately, the specific criteria used will depend on the goals and requirements of the system in question.
