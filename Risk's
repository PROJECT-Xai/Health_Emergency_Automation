8. Risks

  *Weather and environmental factors
	Adverse weather conditions like strong winds and snow could impend drone operations or lead to damaged deliveries, and wildlife may pose a risk to the deliveries.
  *Electrical dependences 
	In this load-shedding era, drones will pose a threat to our project. The drone will be using electricity from both the solar and the batteries, 
  so if it dies along the way the patients might end up not getting their medications.
  *Community Resistance 
	Some communities might not side  the Drone due to noise pollution, safety, or visual aesthetics.
  *Theft & Vandalism
    drones can be targeted since they will be carrying valuable medicine that can be used in the wrong ways,
    especially in those areas with security challenges.
  *Technical Failures
   Drones can experience technical malfunctions, such as communication errors, battery failures, or navigation issues. These failures
   could lead to delayed or failed deliveries, potentially putting patients' health at risk.
  *Loss of Human Interaction
    While drones can enhance efficiency, they may lead to a reduction in personal interaction between patients and healthcare providers.
   Some patients, particularly the elderly, might value the human touch in healthcare services.
