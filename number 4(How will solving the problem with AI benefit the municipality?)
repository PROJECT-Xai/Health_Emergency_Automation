4. How will solving the problem with AI benefit the municipality?
   Project X would benefit the municipality with the listed points:
  *Cost Reduction
	a municipality can save costs associated with traditional methods of medicine distribution, such as maintaining the clinic. This is especially relevant for communities with large populations that depend on one clinic 
  *Efficient healthcare 
	Project X drones will provide more efficient healthcare service by delivering medicine to patients, especially those in remote or hard-to-reach areas, 	which improves access to medication and ensures timely delivery. That leads to better health outcomes.
  *Elderly Care &  
	The elderly population often faces challenges in accessing healthcare, including getting to the pharmacy to pick up prescriptions. Our project can help address this issue by delivering medications directly to them, promoting timely and hassle-free healthcare. Thus improving human independence.
  *Reduce the traffic Congestion
	By reducing the need for people to travel to clinics to collect their medication, Project X drones will help alleviate traffic congestion in urban areas. This 
	indirectly benefits the municipality by improving overall traffic flow and reducing environmental pollution.

  *Enhanced Patient Compliance
	Regular medication adherence is essential for effective treatment. project X can ensure that patients receive their medications on time, increasing the likelihood of them sticking to their prescribed treatment plans and managing their health conditions effectively.
