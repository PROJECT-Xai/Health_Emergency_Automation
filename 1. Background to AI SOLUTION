Background to AI Solution

The whole idea of having autonomous flying drones that delivers medical packages from health care facilities 
(i.e. Clinics, Hospitals and Pharmacies) to the people in need, is more than relevant in helping the community at large. 
The community stands to gain the most from the project because it has the potential to save lives, time, money and also 
improve efficiency while delivering quality medical services. While drones are a visible and tangible part of the PROJECT-Xai program, 
the underlying AI technologies play a crucial role in making the system intelligent, efficient and adaptable to challenges.

The project will use a combination of drones and AI technology such as:
•	Routing and Navigation: We use AI algorithms to help the drones navigate safely and efficiently to destinations.
•	Autonomous flight: Which uses AI systems onboard the drones manage various aspects of flight, ensuring stability and safe operations.
•	Efficiency: Use AI to manage inventory, track demand, and prioritize orders.
