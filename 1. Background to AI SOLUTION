Background to AI Solution

The idea of autonomous flying drones that deliver medical packages from healthcare facilities 
(i.e., Clinics, Hospitals, and Pharmacies) to people in need is more than relevant in helping the community. 
The community stands to gain the most from the project because it has the potential to save lives, time, and money and also 
improve efficiency while delivering quality medical services. While drones are a visible and tangible part of the PROJECT-Xai program, 
the underlying AI technologies make the system intelligent, efficient, and adaptable to challenges.

The project will use a combination of drones and AI technology, such as:
•	Routing and Navigation: We use AI algorithms to help drones navigate safely and efficiently to destinations.
•	Autonomous flight: This uses AI systems onboard the drones to manage various aspects of aviation, ensuring stability and safe operations.
•	Efficiency: Use AI to manage inventory, track demand, and prioritize orders.
