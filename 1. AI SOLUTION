The whole idea of having autonomous flying drones that deliver medical packages from distribution centers to the people in need is 
more than relevent in helping the community at large as they are the ones who stand to gain the most in this project. The whole
technology that goes into it particularly the AI side of things has the potential to save lives, time, money and also improve efficiency
in delivering quality medical services. while drones are a visible and tangible part of the (_the name of the company gents_) program,
the underlying AI technologies play a crucial role in making the system intelligent, efficient , and adaptable to challenges.

The combination of drones and AI technology such as:

i) routing and navigation: which uses AI algorithms to help the drones navigate safely and efficiently to their destinations.
ii) autonomous flight: which uses AI systems onboard the drones manage various aspects of flight, ensuring stability and safe operations.
iii) order fulfilment: use AI to manage inventory, track demand, and prioritize orders.
