Question number 8: Model It is clear how the AI Model that is developed will be evaluated for accuracy.
 The Evaluation should be an ongoing process, and regular updates to the AI Model and Drones systems will
be necessary to maintain accuracy and reliability as the Projects evolves.
With that being mentioned the follow aspects will give a better understanding in the Accuracy of the Drones.	

2. Medication Drop Accuracy:
Set up target zones in your testing environment to represent delivery points.
Measure accuracy by calculating the distance between the intended delivery point and the actual drop point of the medication.
Implement mechanisms to adjust the drone's altitude and speed during the delivery to improve drop accuracy.

5. Communication Reliability:
Simulate communication disruptions between the drone and the control center during testing.
Evaluate the drone's behavior during communication loss, including its ability to return to a safe location or 
complete the delivery autonomously.

6. Redundancy Testing:
Intentionally disable or simulate failures in key systems, such as sensors or communication modules.
Assess how well the drone's redundancy systems kick in to ensure continued operation and safe delivery.

7. Real-World Testing:
Gradually transition from controlled testing environments to real-world scenarios.
Monitor the drone's accuracy and reliability during actual medication deliveries.
Collect data on successful and unsuccessful deliveries to refine the AI model over time.

8. User Feedback:
Gather feedback from recipients on the accuracy and reliability of the drone's deliveries.
Use user feedback to identify any issues or areas for improvement in the AI model.

9. Continuous Improvement:
Continuously update and optimize the AI model based on the data collected from real-world testing and user feedback.
Implement machine learning techniques to improve the model's performance over time.
